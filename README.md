# MongoDB Login


## Please note that the page is under development and is only desktop responsive

## Overview

- This App is the clone of original Netflix signup UI and can be previewed by cloning into local directory
- It is not hosted on any hosting service due to copyright issues
- I've used MongoDB for storing login info for the ADMIN
- Two routes have been created for the home and login

## Usage

- Open Gitbash/Terminal/Windows-Powershell

- Copy the following command to clone this repository in your local storage:
```
git clone https://github.com/pooranjoyb/mongodb-auth.git
```
- Hit the Enter key.

It would take a few seconds to clone the repository onto your system.<br>
**Note:** Cloning depends on the internet connection and the time would depend on your connection bandwidth. If Git is not able to clone due to a weak connection, it would display a fatal error and the user is requested to try again until the above message does not appear.

- Check in the local drive by navigating to it manually.
